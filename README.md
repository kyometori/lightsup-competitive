# LightsUp Competitive

A fast-paced, competitive twist on the classic "Lights Out" puzzle game. Instead of just one puzzle, you're racing against the clock to solve three at once!

## The Classic Game: "Lights Out"

"Lights Out" is a classic electronic puzzle game from the 90s. The premise is simple:

- You are presented with a grid of lights, some of which are on and some are off.
- The goal is to turn **all** the lights on.
- When you press a light, it toggles its state (on to off, or off to on). But here's the catch: it **also** toggles the state of every adjacent light (up, down, left, and right).

This simple mechanic leads to surprisingly complex and satisfying puzzles.

## The Competitive Twist: LightsUp

**LightsUp Competitive** takes this core concept and turns it into a high-speed challenge designed for replayability and competition.

### Core Gameplay

- **Three Boards, One Goal**: Instead of one puzzle, you are faced with **three** separate player boards and **three** target patterns.
- **Match the Patterns**: Your goal is to make each of your boards match the corresponding target pattern as quickly as possible.
- **Beat the Clock**: Your score is the total time it takes to solve all three boards. The lower your time, the better!

### Features for Competition & Replayability

This version is built with features to create a fair, challenging, and customizable competitive environment.

#### Game Modes

Mix and match modes to create different challenges:

-   **Random Start**: Instead of starting with all lights off, your boards will begin in a randomly scrambled state. This can sometimes give you a head start, or a much tougher puzzle to unravel.
-   **Hard Mode**: A true test of focus and speed. If you don't make a move on any *unsolved* board for more than 10 seconds, the game is over!

#### Competition Seeding

-   **Fair & Reproducible Puzzles**: A "seed" is a piece of text that controls the random number generator. By using the same seed, two players can face the exact same set of target patterns and initial board states.
-   **Challenge Your Friends**: Find a challenging seed? Share it with friends to see who can get the best time on the same set of puzzles.
-   **Records with Seeds**: Every game has a seed, whether you enter one or the game generates one for you. When you set a new best time, the seed is saved with your record, allowing you to replay your greatest triumphs.

#### User Preferences

Tailor the game to your liking. The preferences modal allows you to:

-   **Disable Animations**: For a cleaner, distraction-free experience.
-   **Hide Timers & Move Counts**: Play purely by feel without the pressure of the clock.
-   **Adjust Countdown**: Set the pre-game countdown to 5s, 3s, or skip it entirely to jump straight into the action.

### Controls

-   **Mouse**: Click on a tile to flip it.
-   **Spacebar**: Start the game from the main menu.
-   **R**: Restart the current game at any time.
-   **Q**: Quit the current game and return to the main menu.

Good luck, and may your clicks be swift!
